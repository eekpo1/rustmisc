# What's In Here: Various DS/Libraries I create using rust

### Author: Eddie Ekpo

## Libraries
1. **RustPars** : An implementation of groovy's old GPars Library that definitely doesn't do it justice.
2. **Distance Measuring Algorithms** : Coming soon... This I may port from my julia spaghetti code
3. **Classification** : ML classification algs. Coming soon
4. **Regression**: ML based regression algs. Also coming soon



## Data Structures/Algs 
1. (Stack/Queues/Priority Queues/Heaps/BST/etc coming soon)


# Note: This is for learning purposes only. I will compartmentalize these implementations into a standard library format when I've progressed enough in the language to think they're worth doing so.
